<!-- | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two levels: | |  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user,  |                 and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml. | |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option: | |                 -s /path/to/user/settings.xml | |  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all Maven |                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven |                 installation). It's normally provided in  |                 ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml. | |                 NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option: | |                 -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml | | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start at | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate, the default | values (values used when the setting is not specified) are provided. | |-->

  <!-- profiles   | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify   | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.   |   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is    | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.   |   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially   | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a    | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.   |   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration   |       variables for plugins in the POM.   |   |-->
